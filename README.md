## The Battle of Polytopia
The Battle of Polytopia is a 4X turn-based strategy game developed and published by Midjiwan AB.
Players play as one of sixteen tribes to develop an empire and defeat opponents in a low poly square-shaped world.
Players can play against bots or human opponents, local or online.
The game was initially released in February 2016 and November 2016 in USA.
The Battle of Polytopia was created by Felix Ekenstam, a Swedish freelancer who developed Flash games. He founded the game's developer indie game studio Midjiwan AB and was its sole employee at first.[9] Ekenstam began drawing concept art in 2012, and worked on the title in his spare time until its release.[1] Ekenstam intended for Polytopia to be a strategy game that featured the simplicity common with other mobile games, and without heavy focus on microtransactions.[10] Midjiwan released several updates for the game after release; the company's CEO Christian LÃ¶vstedt said that the team tested various new ideas and concepts for gameplay, but mentioned that studio eliminated "90% of everything it tests".[11] Ekenstam related that he regularly kept contact with players on social media to hint at new gameplay elements and ask for feedback.[1] Polytopia was originally created through Adobe Flash,[12] but was later developed through Unity.[13]
